    "## What is Django?\n",
    "    Django is a Python framework that makes it easier to create web sites using Python.\n",
    "    Django takes care of the difficult stuff so that you can concentrate on building your web applications.\n",
    "### How does Django Work?\n",
    "    Django follows the MVT design pattern (Model View Template).\n",
    "    - Model : The data you want to present, usually data from a database.\n",
    "    - View : A request handler that returns the relevant template and content - based on the request from the user.\n",
    "    - Template : A text file (like an HTML file) containing the layout of the web page, with logic on how to display the data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Model\n",
    "    The model provides data from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In Django, the data is delivered as an Object Relational Mapping (ORM), which is a technique designed to make it easier to work with databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The most common way to extract data from a database is SQL. One problem with SQL is that you have to have a pretty good understanding of the database structure to be able to work with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Django, with ORM, makes it easier to communicate with the database, without having to write complex SQL statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The models are usually located in a file called models.py.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### View\n",
    "    A view is a function or method that takes http requests as arguments, imports the relevant model(s), and finds out what data to send to the template, and returns the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The views are usually located in a file called views.py.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Template\n",
    "    A template is a file where you describe how the result should be represented.\n",
    "    The templates of an application is located in a folder named templates.\n",
    "### URLs :\n",
    "    Django also provides a way to navigate around the different pages in a website.\n",
    "\n",
    "    When a user requests a URL, Django decides which view it will send it to.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This is done in a file called urls.py.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Flow :\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.Django receives the URL, checks the urls.py file, and calls the view that matches the URL.\n",
    "    2.The view, located in views.py, checks for relevant models.\n",
    "    3.The models are imported from the models.py file.\n",
    "    4.The view then sends the data to a specified template in the template folder.\n",
    "    5.The template contains HTML and Django tags, and with the data it returns finished HTML content back to the browser.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
